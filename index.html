      <p class="home-p1">
        I've always had a passion for software. It began with hacking my
        parent's home computer as a child, then evolved into teaching myself
        python in high school. Today I am learning full stack development, and
        despite the years of work I've put in already, I have not yet had
        enough. I want to work hard, deliver real results, and never stop
        learning in a field that moves faster every year.
